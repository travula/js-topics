#+title:  Reactive Programming and the Actor Model of Asynchronous Computing
#+setupfile:  ../org-templates/level-1.org

* Objective 

We discuss the basics of the /reactive/ model of computing
as used in building web applications.  Actors are entities
that hold local state and communicate with each other by
sending messages.  An actor /reacts/ to the message it
receives by either modifying its local state or sending
messages to other actors, or both.


In what follows, we present three models of implementation
of actors in Javascript: 


-  [[./actor-object.org][An Actor implementation in Javascript]]  :: Each actor is
     an object with a method =react=.

-  [[./actor-handler.org][Evolving Reactivity Incrementally]] :: The reaction
     interface of an actor is controlled incrementally by
     binding handlers to messages (aka events).

- [[./actor-closure.org][Actors as Closures]]  :: Actors have with encapsulated state
     but with a fixed reaction interface.
